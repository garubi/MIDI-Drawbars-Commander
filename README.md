# MIDI Drawbars Commander

## Pedals:
### Expression pedal
Any "standard" expression pedal compatible with the Roland EV5 will do.

### Switch pedal (leslie speed)
You should use a Normally Open non latching (momentary) pedal to toggle the Leslie's speed, otherwise the "switch impulse" is sent on pedal release instead of pedal push (see issue #24)

## SysEX implementation
Since v. 2.0 the device has a full set of custom System Exclusive messages that you can use to can configure what kind of commands/codes every button and drawbar sends.

An editor is already available to configure the device. You can find it here: https://github.com/garubi/Web-editor-for-MIDI-Drawbars-Commander

**Format for the requests:**

`F0 X_MANID1 X_MANID2 X_PRODID X_REQ COOMAND vv F7`

**Format for the reply:**

`F0 X_MANID1 X_MANID2 X_PRODID X_REP OBJECT (Reply COdes) vv F7`

**Manufacturer ID and Product ID**

* `X_MANID1 = 0x37` // Manufacturer ID 1
* `X_MANID2 = 0x72` // Manufacturer ID 2
* `X_PRODID = 0x09` // Product ID

**Where ACTION is:**
* `X_REQ = 0x00` // Request
* `X_REP = 0x01` // Replay

**Where COMMAND is:**
* `X_FW_VER 			= 0x01`
// Firmware version. Replay vv is VERSION_MAJOR VERSION_MINOR VERSION_PATCH.
* `X_ACTIVE_PRESET 	= 0x02` // The active preset. Replay vv is (byte) Active preset id [0-3].
* `X_CTRL_INFO 		= 0x03` // Reply with info about the controls: 1) Number of presets slots (PRESETS_COUNT), 2) Buttons number (BTN_COUNT), 3) Drawbars number (DRWB_COUNT)
* `X_REQ_CTRL_PARAMS = 0x10` // Current settings for a control: PRESET_ID CTRL_ID. Reply vv is: PRESET_ID CTRL_ID UPP_Type UPP_Prm UPP_Min UPP_Max UPP_Ch UPP_behavior LOW_Type LOW_Prm LOW_Min LOW_Max LOW_Ch LOW_behavior ALT_Type ALT_Prm ALT_Min ALT_Max ALT_Ch ALT_behavior

Reply vv is 0 if is all right, an Error code if something went wrog
* `X_SET_PARAM 		= 0x12` //Send a setting for a single parameter (but doesn't save it): PRESET_ID CTRL_ID PARAM_ID (0-18) param value;
* `X_CMD_SAVE_PRESET= 0x7F` // Save the Preset to the non volative memory: vv is PRESET_ID. Reply vv is 0 if all went ok, an error code if someting wen wrong

**REPLY CODES**
* `X_OK = 0x00`
* `X_ERROR = 0x7F` // Something went wrong. It will be followed by one of the following error codes

**ERROR CODES**

## Factory restore
You can restore the presets factory defaults with the following procedure
- **turn off** the MIDI Drawbars Comamnder (i.e. detach from the USB cable)
- **press and hold the *ALT* button while turning on the Commander** (i.e. attach the USB cable). This will boot the Commander in *Reset mode*. The "*Leslie fast*" button's led will start blinking
- **while holding the *ALT* button, press the blinking "*Leslie fast*" button** to wipe the memory and reload the factory presets. The led will stop blink.
- **TODO: how to know when the restore finish?**
- Now **release the *ALT* button**: the Commander will exit from the *Reset mode* and it's ready to perform using the default parameters.
